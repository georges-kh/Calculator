# Calculator
A desktop calculator that can perform addition, subtraction,
division, and multiplication.
It can also invert the sign of the current number on display
and divide it by 100

Bugs to fix:
- changing operators (except for + and -) evaluates to 0
- the delete button (x button) will remove a returned value but
numbers will still be calculated normally

Things left to do:
- clean up the code
- lock the transition on the operator buttons until an evaluation
has been completed or a new operator has been chosen
